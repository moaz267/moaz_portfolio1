    "description": "I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with solid experience in building modern and responsive web applications using React.js. I have strong knowledge of HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, and JavaScript (ES6+), along with hands-on experience in React Router for efficient client-side routing. I'm comfortable working with Bootstrap for styling, and I use Axios and the native Fetch API for data fetching and integration. My workflow is supported by version control tools like Git & GitHub, and I rely on Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my main development environment. I also focus on delivering multilingual user experiences by integrating internationalization (i18n) using libraries like react-i18next. For deployment, I use Vercel to host and manage production-ready applications seamlessly.",
